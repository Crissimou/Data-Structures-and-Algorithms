# Laboratory Activity: Graphing using matplotlib
This Python script reads data from a text file, applies various mathematical equations to the data, writes the results to another text file, and plots the results.

## How to Run
1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Run the script using the command `python script_name.py`.

## Features
- **Data Reading**: The script reads data from a file named `data2.txt`. The data should be in the form of integers, one per line.
- **Equations**: The script applies ten different mathematical equations to the data. These equations range from simple linear equations to more complex polynomial and trigonometric equations.
- **Results Writing**: The results of each equation are written to a file named `all_results.txt`.
- **Graph Plotting**: The script plots the results of each equation. The user can choose to plot the results of a single equation or all equations together. The graphs are color-coded for easy distinction.

## User Interaction
The script prompts the user to enter the number of the equation they want to plot. The user can enter a number between 1 and 10 to plot a specific equation, or 11 to plot all equations. After plotting, the script asks the user if they want to view another graph.

## Dependencies
This script depends on the following Python libraries:
- matplotlib
- numpy

Please ensure these are installed before running the script.
